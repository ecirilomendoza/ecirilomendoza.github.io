 I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Economics at the University of Warwick. Prior to this, I worked as a Research Assistant at Universidad de Piura (UDEP), and as a Teaching Assistant alongside [Alexander Quispe](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/) for the course Causal Inference and Machine Learning. I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). Additionally, I have contributed to the development of the Causal Inference and Machine Learning Bookdown, focusing on innovative estimation methods in R and Python. My primary areas of academic interest encompass microeconomics, causal inference, and machine learning.

 In this site, you will find more about my research experience, code and writings.
