 I am a Research Assistant at GERENS School of Management. I got my degree in economics at PUCP. Additionally, I am working with [Alexander Quispe](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/) as a Teaching Assistant in the course Causal Inference and Machine Learning. I have helped him to develop the [Causal Inference and Machine Learning Bookdown](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/ml_book/), which covers novel estimation methods in <code>R</code> and <code>Python</code>.

 My main fields of interest are microeconomics, causal inference and machine learning. 

 In this site, you will find more about my research experience, code and writings.
