[Github-Repo](): The snippet estimates the travel time to get to any geolocated place for each grid of population in a country. Inspired by [Rodriguez-Segura and Heseung](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352728521000063?via%3Dihub), we use a novel database of the population in each grid of a country, and a friction surface raster developed by [Malaria Atlas Project (MAP)](https://malariaatlas.org/research-project/accessibility-to-healthcare/) to account for travel times in R. [Alexander Quispe](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/) guided the project. We can use the snippet for further public policy analysis.
