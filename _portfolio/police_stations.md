[Github-Repo](https://github.com/ecirilomendoza/police_stations): The snippet cleans data of [geolocated police stations](https://www.datosabiertos.gob.pe/dataset/relaci%C3%B3n-de-comisar%C3%ADas-b%C3%A1sicas), and plots them in a map. It also adds relevant information of each police station feature collected from The National Census of Police Stations in Peru. [Alexander Quispe](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/) guided the project.
